## Overview

This is my first challenge from the Frontend Mentor website. Really planning to improve as much as possible my CSS skills at first and this seems like the perfect way to do it. This first challenge is great at applying most essentials principles like flex and position.

## My process

I tried to recreate the adequate width and height, and then built the components around it, playing with margins to reach as much as possible pixel perfect.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

How to quickly initialize :root for fonts and colors to use throughout the project.

Also as a first project it was perfect to use all the major things I basically just learned, such as flexbox, center a div with position absolute /transform: translate.

### Continued development

Definitely need to learn how to plan out before coding. Especially regarding how to deal with width and height to reach pixel perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Add to go through position absolute again to make sure how to center the container the easy way.
